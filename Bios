Frozen:If you venture down into the icey depths of the Monstrous Realm, you will eventually gaze upon the Frozen Cove. Perhaps it's the rumours that draw attention to it? Any monster deciding to dwell into the abyss never returns, for the expanse of tunnels is nothing but a trap. No monster can never reach the end of the system, where it is said all the treasure in the world lies. For before they do, they end up frozen in ice! And to top it all off, the treasure there has already been stolen!
