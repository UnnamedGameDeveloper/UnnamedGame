Frozen:Nestled in the glacial expanse of the Icey Depths lies the enchanting Frozen Cove. It is a misfortune for a monster to end up trapped on the island, as it is impossible to escape from it's grasp. For when a monster leaves it's home and voyages into the abyss in search of loot, they normally end up incased in ice! From there, the monster is carried along a stream and eventually dropped into the very centre of the island, and stuck there for eternity.
