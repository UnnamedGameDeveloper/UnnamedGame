Niblite:With its glowing body, the Niblite is who you go to when the Cove starts to turn dark. Its bulb is said to be able to glow so bright, it can light up the entire Island! Though its as bright can be, it provides no warmth for the other Monsters.. Note that the surges going through its body from its Bulb keep the Niblites heart beating, and if that runs out, its gone for good.
Pitchfall:From their witty jokes to their excellent singing skills, Pitchfalls are among the most cheerful Monsters you'll ever meet! These spring beans begin life in pods within the Deciduous Trees of Whisperwood Grove. Once fully grown, they shed their age-bound shell and bring their, shall we say, unique voice wherever they go - whether floating through Broken Reality or living in an everlasting Cove.
Shadolt:Masters of deception in the Elemental World, Shadolts are notorious for their clever cons involving counterfeit currency. The orbs they stand upon may resemble precious coins, but they're elaborate fakes. When an unsuspecting Monster attempts to purchase one of these false orbs, the Shadolt leaps from its body to possess the patron, continuing its search for new Monsters to scam.
Wallagumper:Listen closely and you might hear the distinctive calls and wails of the Wallagumper echoing through the Cove! This peculiar Monster, said to hail from an Ancient Village, has one particularly odd quirk - it becomes strangely agitated at the mere sight of a goose. Who knows?
Potaschpell:What happens when you mix every Potion imaginable into a single brew? The Potaschpell is living proof! Legend tells of an evil Witch who, while brewing a Potion to seize control of an Enchanted Kingdom, added far too many ingredients to her concoction. To her amazement, a pair of glowing green eyes emerged from the mixture, and thus the Potaschpell was born!
Stitchum:Recently freed from their Icy Prison, the Stitchum bears a peculiar curse - forever bound by Magical Strings it once tried desperately to break. Rather than fight its fate, the Stitchum discovered that its binding silk can create beautiful music when plucked. Now it spends its days mastering these restraints, though it still gives them an occasional tug, just to check.
Jelteejug:SPLASH! SPLASH! Here comes the astounding Jelteejug! Similar to all 'drinkable' Monsters in the Elemental World, its body contains Toxic Juice that no one should taste, for the benefit of both parties. This Monsters true value lies in its role as the Cove's Guardian. Thanks to its ability to breathe underwater, the Jelteejug regularly catches fish to feed its fellow Monsters.
Ribeat:Known as the Glutton of the Frozen Cove, Ribeat descends from one of the Elemental Worlds mightiest predators. This Monsters excessive appetite has created its own unique gravitational pull - treats orbit around it! Despite barely being able to move, Ribeat never goes hungry as snacks quite literally revolve around Ribeat, causing not so occasional food shortages.
Chygll:Rumored to be a creation of the great TinkerTonker itself, the mechanical marvel known as Chygll began its life in the TinkerTonkers workshop, however after the Gearsnap Ziggazap incident, it found itself abandoned in an Icy Cave beneath the surface. Adapting to its new environment, Chygll collected gold and gems during its subterranean explorations until an unfortunate trip-wire sent it tumbling straight into the Frozen Cove.
Lumintipus:A Cyber-Squid native to the Frozen Depths, Lumintipus is the only Monster capable of leaving the Cove at will. Its Human World squid-like form is adorned with Ice Crystals and a Golden Shell at its center, wading beautiful light shows in the waters. Despite their ability to freely roam the depths, each Lumintipus chooses to stay in the Cove, having found something more valuable than freedom - a home among friends.
Djyeti:The fabled Djyeti draws equal measures of fear and respect from those who speak its name. Though drawn to the Frozen Cove by an insatiable hunger for treasure, this massive Monster now spends its days crafting Ice Sculptures. Don't let the facade fool you - beneath that bulk beats a surprisingly warm heart.
Escarmor:Once a lost gastropod, Escarmor found its way to the TinkerTonkers workshop and left as something more - a machine complete with upgrades and weaponry. After the TinkerTonkers disappearance, this wanderer drifted through Frozen Wastes until fate, and also melting ice sent it to the Cove.
ToTempo:ToTempo stands as the perfect example of cooperation. Pod provides the foundation and nutrients, Peaks keeps watch for threats, while Pog and Puff - well, no one quite knows what they do, but they're essential parts of this Totem all the same.
Musharp:Deep in the Fungal Forests of Pholowah, Musharps craft their own instruments from psychically shaped secretions. These unusual Monsters nurture their strings, tending to them like delicate Garden Vines. Once matured, the strings resonate with their shared Psychic Energy - some say they can even hear whispers of the Forest in their sleep.
