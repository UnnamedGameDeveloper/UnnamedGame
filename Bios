Frozen:Nestled in the glacial expanse of the Icey Depths lies the enchanting Frozen Cove. It is a misfortune for a monster to end up trapped on the island, as it is impossible to escape from it's grasp. For when a monster leaves it's home and voyages into the abyss in search of loot, they normally end up incased in ice! From there, the monster is carried along a stream and eventually dropped into the very centre of the island, and stuck there for eternity. 
Chygll:It is rumoured that the illusive Chygll was crafted from the many mechanical hands of the great TinkerTonker himself. This marvellous machine originates from the workshop of the TinkerTonker, but after the incident of the Gearsnap Ziggazap, was left abandoned in a dark, icey cave beneath the surface. Over time, this monster adapted to it's environment, picking up gold and gems as it ventured deeper and deeper into the network. Eventually, this monster tripped a wire, and was sent tumbling down a chute straight into the Frozen Cove. How unfortunate!
Djyeti:The fabled Djyeti is a cryptid of staggering mystery. Wise monsters speak tales of its great strength, whilst others fear it.  However - the longing for treasures and riches is far too powerful even for a Monster of such will as the Djyeti. Due to its chilly fate within the Frozen Cove, there has been no definitive proof of the monsters existence. When not debated among skeptics, the Djyeti  plays songs on its reliable and sturdy drum! Although the Djyeti might seem very bulky and strong, it has a big and warm heart! It may look irritated or angry, but that's just a well-crafted facade.
Escarmor:Escarmor was taken in at a young age by the great TinkerTonker. This unfortunate soul had become lost from it's gallant group of gastropods, and ended up right at the workshop's doorstep. Out of the kindness of the TinkerTonker's mechanical oil-filled heart, it repaired Escarmor back to full health, armouring it with countless upgrades and weaponry on it. After the incident, this monster was abandoned in a frozen tundra to fend for itself. After many days of wondering around, Escarmor found solace in a cave beneath a mountain. However, in the monster's sleep, it was carried down a slope by melting ice, and ended up inside a gigantic cove!
