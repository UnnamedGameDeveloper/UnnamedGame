Niblite:With it's glowing body, this monster is really helpful when the island starts to turn dark, as it's body's light source is said to be able to light up almost the whole island. Sadly though, even though it's as bright as it can be, it provides no warmth for its colleagues. And if the light was to go out, Niblite would basically just... die. The surges going through it's body that keep it's heart beating are produced by the lightbulb on top of it's head, so if that runs out, it's gone for good.

Wallagumper:If you have a keen ear, you might hear the calls and wails of the Wallagumper. I was lucky enough to be one of those people! From the looks of it, it seems to come from an old village, or something like that. Oddly enough,  it got irritated at the sight of a goose. I wonder what it could mean? Either way, the Wallagumper is weird, but I can't help but chuckle at it sometimes.
Potaschpell:Have you ever wondered what would happen if you mixed together every drink that you could find into one? The Potaschpell is the perfect example of this! Rumours say that years ago, an evil witch was brewing up a remedy in order to seize power over an enchanted kingdom. After pouring in far too many ingredients into her batch of beverages, she was stunned to see a pair of green glowing eyes staring back!
Stitchum:i forgot because these used to be on the other server but then I switched servers bcuz that one got found too lol
Jelteejug:SPLASH! SPLASH! Here comes the glorious Jelteejug! Similar to all "drinkable" friends in this vast monsterous plane, you do not wanna taste the toxic juice that inhabits the body of the Jelteejug. This large jelly figure stands a crucial role in why all the monsters decided to take a journey down to the cove. They were the one to notify the others of the prized items that sit in the depths below. Why would they listen to them? The reason is that the Jellteejug is one of the nicest monsters to ever step foot in the cove! Jelteejugs can breathe in the water that surrounds the cove, so they timely catch some fish for the rest of the monsters to eat. What a helpful jar of joy!
Rib-Eat:The Rib-Eat is regarded as the "Glutton" of the Frozen Cove, and is often the main cause of food scarcities within the icey fortress. Unexpectedly, this food-fixated monster is a descendant of one of the Elemental World's strongest predators. However, due to Rib-Eat's excessive eating, the monster can hardly even move! Instead, it attempts to lean towards and eat the gumballs surrounded it. How lazy!
Chygll:It is rumoured that the illusive Chygll was crafted from the many mechanical hands of the great TinkerTonker himself. This marvellous machine originates from the workshop of the TinkerTonker, but after the incident of the Gearsnap Ziggazap, was left abandoned in a dark, icey cave beneath the surface. Over time, this monster adapted to it's environment, picking up gold and gems as it ventured deeper and deeper into the network. Eventually, this monster tripped a wire, and was sent tumbling down a chute straight into the Frozen Cove. How unfortunate!
Timbalog:timbalog is uhh a log, it is made from wood. however the truth is it is a giant eyeball with a bunc hfo pupils and the log is just the shell to disguise the monster. also if you mute it its knees do a 360 !
Lumintipus:squidward
Djyeti:The fabled Djyeti is a cryptid of staggering mystery. Wise monsters speak tales of its great strength, whilst others fear it. However - the longing for treasures and riches is far too powerful even for a Monster of such will as the Djyeti. Due to its chilly fate within the Frozen Cove, there has been no definitive proof of the monsters existence. When not debated among skeptics, the Djyeti  plays songs on its reliable and sturdy drum! Although the Djyeti might seem very bulky and strong, it has a big and warm heart! It may look irritated or angry, but that's just a well-crafted facade.
Escarmor:Escarmor was taken in at a young age by the great TinkerTonker. This unfortunate soul had become lost from it's gallant group of gastropods, and ended up right at the workshop's doorstep. Out of the kindness of the TinkerTonker's mechanical oil-filled heart, it repaired Escarmor back to full health, armouring it with countless upgrades and weaponry on it. After the incident, this monster was abandoned in a frozen tundra to fend for itself. After many days of wondering around, Escarmor found solace in a cave beneath a mountain. However, in the monster's sleep, it was carried down a slope by melting ice, and ended up inside a gigantic cove!
